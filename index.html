        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Using fantasy as a guide towards creation, Mimi Doan & Cole Stapleton have been collaborating as
            choreographers since 2019. Expanding beyond the purely imaginary or erotic, Company [REDACTED]
            utilizes the fantasy of situation and circumstance, emotion and play to create dynamic worlds for their
            pieces. Their first evening-length work, Some Land of Redemption, premiered with two sold out
            performances at The Center for Performance Research in February of 2022, and since then theyâ€™ve been
            invited to create work at Impulstanz in Vienna and at dance festivals throughout New York City.</p>
