                        Using fantasy as a guide towards creation, Mimi Doan & Cole Stapleton have been collaborating as
                        choreographers since 2019. Expanding beyond the purely imaginary or erotic, Company [REDACTED]
                        utilizes the fantasy of situation and circumstance, emotion and play to create dynamic worlds
                        for
                        their
                        pieces. Their first evening-length work, Some Land of Redemption, premiered with two sold out
                        performances at The Center for Performance Research in February of 2022, and since then they’ve
                        been
                        invited to present work at Impulstanz in Vienna, Movement Research @ Judson Church, Hannah Traore Gallery, and at dance festivals throughout New York City.

                                Simon's Rock, and obtained an Associates Degree in Biology & Dance. Then with a deep
                                yearning for more dance, they moved to NYC to attend Hunter College for a BA in Dance,

                                resilient, stubborn, and unbound honesty. </p>
